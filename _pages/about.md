I am a PhD candidate in Cyber Security, Privacy, and Trust at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr. [Myrto Arapinis](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/marapini/). I previously completed my MSc in Cyber Security, Privacy, and Trust at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with distinction. Before that, I earned a double degree in Information Security (BSc) and Law (LLB) from Nankai University.

My research lies at the intersection of provable security and applied cryptography. I am particularly interested in electronic voting, multi-party computation, and blockchain systems. My current work focuses on formal security modeling and the construction of cryptographic protocols that achieve strong coercion-resistance guarantees. 

<!-- More broadly, I am motivated by the goal of designing cryptographic systems with mathematically precise security guarantees that remain meaningful in real-world deployment settings. -->

You can reach me at J.Qiao-3@sms.ed.ac.uk.
